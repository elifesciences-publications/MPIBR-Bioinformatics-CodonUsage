## HRI codon usage

This repository provides analysis for the codon usage results in the following study:


Alvarez-Castelao, B., tom Dieck, S., Fusco, C.M., Donlin-Asp, P.G., Perez, J.D., and Schuman, E.M. (2020)
The switch-like expression of Heme-regulated kinase 1 mediates neuronal proteostasis following proteasome inhibition.

HRI uses more rare codons than the 86.78% of the genes expressed in the brain (see publication [methods](https://elifesciences.org/articles/52714) for more details).
